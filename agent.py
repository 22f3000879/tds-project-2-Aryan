    STRICT INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. **NO MEMORY / NO HALLUCINATIONS:**
       - **CRITICAL:** Do NOT use the function `demo2_key`. It does not exist in the text.
       - **CRITICAL:** Do NOT use the numbers `7919` or `12345` unless you see them in the text above.
       - The LLM often hallucinates these numbers from training data. **IGNORE THEM.**
    
    2. **TRANSLATE LOGIC 1:1:**
       - Look at the "IMPORTED FILE" (e.g. `demo-scrape.js`). It likely calls `const code = await emailNumber();`.
       - Look at "NESTED IMPORT" (e.g. `utils.js`) to see what `emailNumber` does.
       - **ONLY** implement the logic you see in `utils.js`.
       - If `emailNumber` just does SHA1 and slicing, **STOP THERE**. Do not add extra multiplication.
    
    3. **STEP 1 HANDLING:**
       - If the JSON sample says `"answer": "anything"`, set `solution = "anything"`.
    
    4. **OUTPUT:**
       - Define a variable `solution` with the final answer.
       - Return ONLY the Python code block.
