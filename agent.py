    STRICT INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. **NO NETWORK CALLS:** - Do **NOT** import or use `requests`. 
       - Do **NOT** try to POST data in Python. 
       - Just calculate the answer and set `solution = ...`.
    
    2. **STEP 1 HANDLING:** - If the question asks to "POST this JSON" or if the JSON sample says `"answer": "anything"`, simply write:
       - `solution = "anything you want"`
    
    3. **STEP 2 HANDLING (CRITICAL):**
       - Look at `utils.js` in the DATA section.
       - **FORBIDDEN:** Do NOT use the function `demo2_key`. It is a hallucination.
       - **FORBIDDEN:** Do NOT use the numbers `7919` or `12345` unless they are explicitly written in `utils.js`.
       - **ONLY** implement the logic exactly as seen in `utils.js`. 
       - If `emailNumber` just returns `int(sha1(email)[:4], 16)`, then write EXACTLY that.
    
    4. **SYNCHRONOUS ONLY:** - No `async` or `await`.
    
    5. **OUTPUT:**
       - Define a variable `solution` with the final answer.
       - Return ONLY the Python code block.
